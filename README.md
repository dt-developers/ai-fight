# AI Fight

This repository is the source code generated by different AIs.

# AI who?

The AI used here are:

* [ChatGPT 3.5](https://chat.openai.com/)
* [ChatGPT 4](https://chat.openai.com/) _requires payed subscription_
* [CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) _first 30 days for free_ and
* [Android Studio Bot](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/studio-bot) _sofar not available in EU_

# Code

The generated code is split by its generating AI under [app/src/main/java/de/telekom/theaifight/](app/src/main/java/de/telekom/theaifight/) and the unit tests are located under [app/src/test/java/de/telekom/theaifight](app/src/test/java/de/telekom/theaifight). Each package contains the same structure: An `Algorithms.kt` for the tests 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 and a `TicTacToeActivity.kt` for the tic tac toe game.

Those activities can also be executed on a phone / emulator by building the app. Either open this repository in Android Studio or build it through gradle via `./gradlew assembleDebug`. The [MainActivity](app/src/main/java/de/telekom/theaifight/MainActivity.kt) is used for displaying buttons to start all other activities.
